## Sales microservice

Explain your models and integration with the inventory
microservice, here.

CarCar is an app for Client-end management of an automobile service.
-It manages Inventory, Sales, and Service, along with the staff in said departments.
-Structurally the app is built on RestfulApi's for each service with intergrated polling on the service and sales branchs to allow for continuous updating of and fetching from the database. We used a react front end, designed to be new-user friendly and technician friendly, easily customizable to fit future client demands.

The Sales models include, their fields and enpoints are below:
-Salesperson

First name
Last name
Employee_Id (unique)- (a uuid number auto-generated to attend to possible privacy or authentication needs)
The custom_id (unique) (optional) excepts both text and numbers, or can be left blank. It can be assigned by the user to better suit their needs.

Customer
First name,
Last Name,
Address,
Phone Number,
and Customer_id (unique) (auto-assigned if there is no entry)

Sale

ForeignKeys:
AutomobileVo-maintains vins and automobile sold, not sold status
salsesperson,
price- the price of the sale
sale id- a unique, optional field, not used within the app, provided for future client upgrades
sale_date - a auto-generated field, that marks times of the sale. Provided for client specific needs.

The app is designed to allow both sales and services ends to run continuosly, while constantly fetching and updating the database with essential updates. Each service has it's own poller allowing individual departments service endpoints faster response time from the server.

The endpoints follow with links to request input examples:

Salespeople:
-List/Create                                                 http://localhost:8090/api/salespeople/


-Delete

I've added images of all models, there behaviors, input requirements and expected outputs in the Images file of the main directory.
